## Twitter Flume source

Compiled from various samples using twitter classes to use as source and filter data based on keywords


Tested with HDP 2.3

Installation and use:

1) Install Flume on a node(s) (yum install mapr-flume)
(Note: This package already contains a twitter source for the 1% feed and provides the sink in avro format, not json, and also doesnâ€™t have any keyword filter options)

2) Verify the versions of the twitter core and stream jars in the <FLUME_HOME>/lib directory. These need to be 3.0.6 or later (twitter4j-core-3.0.6.jar & twitter4j-stream-3.0.6.jar)

If they are older versions copy from apache or use the jars available in this github by going to the <FLUME_HOME>/lib directory and executing the commands below

3) run 
	$mvn install
 	copy the file created into <FLUME_HOME>/lib
