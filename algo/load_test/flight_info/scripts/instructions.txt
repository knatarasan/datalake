This Hortonworks Certification Exam consists of tasks that you need to complete successfully. The tasks are located in the EXAM folder on the desktop.


1. The machine you are on now is referred to as the "client machine" in the task instructions. It is an Ubuntu instance configured as an edge node that connects to a Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) 2.2 cluster. You are currently logged in as the "horton" user.

2. Perform all of the tasks on this client machine as the "horton" user. 

3. The HDP 2.2 cluster consists of a single node named namenode. You can SSH from this client machine to namenode as the root user:

ssh root@namenode

The root password is "hadoop".

4. You have very limited Internet access. You are only allowed to view the documentation for Hadoop, Pig, Hive, Sqoop and Flume. Shortcuts to these docs are on the Desktop.

5. There is also a shortcut to Ambari on the Desktop.  Both the username and password to login to Ambari is "admin".

6. If an HDP service is not running, run the start-all-services.sh script in the /home/horton folder:

~/start-all-services.sh

This sends a request to Ambari to start all HDP services. You can view the progress of this request in Ambari.
